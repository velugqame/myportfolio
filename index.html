This is a succinct summary of our hard work from January to October of 2024. This works helps those who are choosing to do either CAT or IT next year as one of their Grade 10 subjects.</p><p>I, like many other students, was very excited to know that we would be doing coding this year in computers. My excitement, however, dimmed a bit due to the daunting feeling that came with knowing that I would be quite confused with all the new things we learned. No matter how challenging it was though, I am proud to be able to say that coding is a lot less intimidating than it was when I first started it this year In January. It is no longer something I face with fear.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/computer.png" alt="" width="487" height="487" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-xs.png 640w, https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-sm.png 768w, https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-md.png 1024w, https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-lg.png 1366w, https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-xl.png 1600w, https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/computer-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://velugqame.github.io/myportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
